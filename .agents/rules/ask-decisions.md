# Decision records

Every **business** or **architecture** decision that affects the product must live in **agent-knowledge**.

## Where

| Type | Folder | Prefix | Index |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| Business | `agent-knowledge/knowledge/decisions/business/` | `BDR-NNNN` | `…/decisions/README.md` |
| Architecture | `agent-knowledge/knowledge/decisions/architecture/` | `ADR-NNNN` | same |

Templates: `agent-knowledge/templates/decision-business.md` · `decision-architecture.md`.

## When to create a record

- An option with trade-offs is chosen or discarded
- MVP scope, a role, or an operational flow changes
- Stack, data model, or an integration is defined or changed
- The user confirms something that was previously a "proposal"

## What to do when documenting

1. Create a file with the next sequential number in its folder
2. Update the index table in `knowledge/decisions/README.md`
3. If applicable, update `knowledge/product/scope/mvp.md` or other docs — do not duplicate; link
4. Status: `proposed` until explicit user confirmation → `accepted`

## What does not need a record

- Trivial implementation details with no business or architecture impact
- Bugs or typos
